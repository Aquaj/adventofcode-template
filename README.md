# advent-of-code-template
[Advent of Code üéÑ](https://adventofcode.com) solving framework by `@Aquaj`

This repository template provides:
- some common useful libraries (run `bundle install` to fetch them)
- a clean README in the eventuality you'd make your solutions public afterwards (see [Usable README](#usable-readme))
- a simple structure to interact with the Advent of Code problems (see [The day-xx.rb files](#the-day-xxrb-files))
- automatic copying of the solution to your clipboard (see [Clipboard access](#clipboard-access))
- a basic test runner to check your solution with (see [Checking your solution against expected values](#checking-your-solution-against-expected-values))
- some general-purposes standard lib enhancements (see [Utility methods](#utility-methods))

## ENV

To run properly the framework needs two specific variables in your environment:
- `YEAR` needs to contain the year we're fetching the exercises and inputs from
- `SESSION` needs to contain a valid session cookie value for [adventofcode.com](https://adventofcode.com) - which you
    can find by logging in and using developer tools (in the "Storage" tab or your browser's equivalent)

A `.env.template` you can complete and rename into `.env` is provided, the gem `dotenv` is setup on the project to
facilitate their manipulation.

## The day-xx.rb files

Each file for the 25 days of the AoC are prefilled with an empty AdventDay template consisting of three parts:
- The `#first_part` method is meant to hold the code to your solution to the first challenge of the day
- The `#second_part` method is meant to hold the code to your solution to the second challenge of the day
- The `#convert_data` method will be used to turn the input from the challenge (dynamically fetched from the website) into
    whatever structure you want it to be. Result of this method call is then accessible through the `#input` method.
    Default (`super`) will simply split line by line.

The first call to `#input` will download the input from AoC's website (provided the `SESSION` env var is set) and store
it in `inputs/<day-number>` to cache it. Those files are not tracked by git.

Running the file (`ruby day-01.rb`) will display the result of your `#first_part` methods, then the result to your
`#second_part` method in order, accompanied each by the time it took to run it.

**Example:**
```ruby
require_relative 'common'

## file contents of input/1
# 123
# 456
# 789

class Day1 < AdventDay
  def first_part
    input.last(2).sum
  end

  def second_part
    input.last(2).map(&:to_s).map(&:reverse).map(&:to_i).sum
  end

  private

  def convert_data(data)
    super.map(&:to_i)
  end
end

Day1.solve
```
```console
$ ruby day-01.rb

#1. 1245 - 0.342ms
#2. 1641 - 0.108ms
```

### Colors and formatting

The output of the solver might be formatted (bold/italics/...) and/or colored. If this is an issue, you can disable it
by running your files with the flag `--no-color`, or by putting `COLOR=false` in your ENV.

### Test data

By running the solution with the `--debug` flag, the solver will attempt to find debug data in the `inputs/debug-{day}`
file.

**Example:**

```console
$ echo '12\n34\n56' > inputs/debug-1
$ ruby day-01.rb # Still works as previously

#1. 1245 - 0.342ms
#2. 1641 - 0.108ms

$ ruby day-01.rb --debug # Runs on debug input

#1. 90 - 0.301ms
#2. 108 - 0.237ms
```

Another way to provide your own debug data is to override the `#debug_input` method in your `DayX` class:

```ruby
require_relative 'common'

class Day1 < AdventDay
  def first_part
    input.last(2).sum
  end

  def second_part
    input.last(2).map(&:to_s).map(&:reverse).map(&:to_i).sum
  end

  private

  def convert_data(data)
    super.map(&:to_i)
  end

  def debug_data
    "13\n34\n56" # Formatted like the input !- PRE #convert_data -!
  end
end

Day1.solve
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è  Caution: the result of `#debug_input` will still be fed to `convert_data`, to test the whole solution ‚Äî
be careful to have it return a string formatted similarly to the input you're going to solve later.**


### Checking your solution against expected values

It is possible to provide expected result values, which will be compared to the results of running your solution
against [debug data](#test-data) before running your actual solver.

The first way is to provide an `EXPECTED_RESULTS` constant Hash inside the class, containing the expected results:

```ruby
require_relative 'common'

class Day1 < AdventDay
  EXPECTED_RESULTS = { 1 => 90, 2 => 108 }.freeze

  def first_part
    input.last(2).sum
  end

  def second_part
    input.last(2).map(&:to_s).map(&:reverse).map(&:to_i).sum
  end

  private

  def convert_data(data)
    super.map(&:to_i)
  end
end

Day1.solve
```

```console
$ cat '12\n34\n56' > inputs/debug-01.rb
$ ruby day-01.rb

EXAMPLES: 1 - (90: 90) ‚úî  | 2 - (108: 108) ‚úî

#1. 1245 - 0.317ms
#2. 1641 - 0.263ms
```

But it is also possible to provide the expected results through the CLI with use of the `--test` argument: (in which
case the suplied values take precedence over the ones in the eventual constant)
```console
$ ruby day-01.rb --test 90,108

EXAMPLES: 1 - (90: 90) ‚úî  | 2 - (108: 108) ‚úî

#1. 1245 - 0.317ms
#2. 1641 - 0.263ms
```

Trying to run in test mode without providing either hte constant or a `--test` parameter will raise an error.

NOTE: the output of test runs is colorized green or red according to the success or failure of the comparison, if this
is an issue check [Colors and formatting](#colors-and-formatting) to disable it.

## Clipboard access

When you run the file with the `--copy <1 or 2>` flag, the lib will copy the result of the specified part into your
clipboard, to make it easier for you to fill it on AoC.

## Utility methods

In the `support/` folder you'll find the `AdventDay` framework class (`support/advent_day.rb`), and a `Patches` module
(`support/patches.rb`) containing some utility patches to the standard ruby library that I've found useful to keep at
hand during exercises.

Feel free to add your own to it.

## Usable README

At the end of this explanation you'll find a complete README you can use almost-as-is for your own repository if you
decide to make your solutions public once the AoC is over.

To set it up you should:
- replace `@yournamehere` by your own name or pseudonym
- replace all `20xx` occurrences (including in urls) by the year the repository is for
- set up the pitch of the year's AoC storyline in [the appropriate section](#advent-of-code-story)

The README also holds a table recapping the repository's solutions content.

Each time an exercise is published you can set its actual name instead of the TBD in the `Day` column, then put a golden
star emoji `üåü` in the appropriate `Part` column when completing it. When working on the solution you can put an hourglassemoji `‚è≥` in the first column, and replace it with a checkmark emoji `‚úîÔ∏è` once you're done with both solutions.

For convenience all 3 emojis are stored in an HTML comment above the table, you only need to copy-paste the appropriate
one in its place.

# Once setup and ready to publish, delete everything before this line including this title

## What is Advent of Code?
[Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com) is an online event created by [Eric Wastl](https://twitter.com/ericwastl).
Each year, starting on Dec 1st, an advent calendar of small programming puzzles are unlocked once a day at midnight
(EST/UTC-5). Developers of all skill sets are encouraged to solve them in any programming language they choose!

## Advent of Code Story

**TODO: Fill in with story pitch from the text of Day 1's challenge**

**These were not written as example of clean or efficient code** but are simply my attempts at finding the answers to
each day's puzzle as quickly as possible. Performance logging was added simply as a fun way to compare implementations
with other competitors.

## Running the code

Run `bundle install` to install any dependencies.

Each day computes and displays the answers to both of the day questions and their computing time in ms. To run it type `ruby day<number>.rb`.

If the session cookie value is provided through the SESSION env variable (dotenv is available to provide it) ‚Äî it will
fetch the input from the website and store it as a file under the `inputs/` folder on its first run.
Lack of a SESSION value will cause the code to raise an exception unless the input file (`inputs/{number}`) already
present. The code will also raise if the input isn't available from AoC's website (`404` error).
